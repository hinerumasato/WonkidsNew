    'background.content' => '‘Wonderful Story’ began with a mother who wanted to read Bible stories to Vietnamese children. The book was planned, designed and published for children with the ‘heart of a mother’. Since then, ‘Wonderful Story’ has reached many Vietnamese children through a camp program developed for short-term mission teams. The continued publication of ‘Wonderful Story’ and the use of it by short-term mission teams have set a good example of a shared mission program between the Vietnamese general assembly of churches and missionaries. Today, ‘Wonderful Story’ has been translated and published into more than 30 local languages around the world and continues to spread in conjunction with camp ministries. In response to the need for continued production and development of educational Christian/Bible content for children in many countries, including Vietnam, the Wonderful Story Kids Club (Won Kids Club) project team was formed in 2016 by Korean missionaries in Vietnam.',

    'value.content' => 'Won Kids Club began with the idea of developing an educational content of the Bible appropriate and suitable for children through utilizing media and disseminating it online in line with the current trend of the world. We hope to help parents and Sunday school teachers who love children to effectively educate children about the Bible every week at home and at church with these contents. We plan to continue to research and develop it to further enrich and enhance the program. It is expected that the Wonderful Story joint project, of the book, the camp, and the club, which began in Vietnam, will play an important role in planting the Kingdom of God in the hearts of children around the world and leading them to live as disciples of Jesus.',
